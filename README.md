### ReBook

A book rental subscription service that will allow you to access from the most popular to the most obscure printed books for as low as $10 a month.

### Problem

Studies have shown that a majority of readers prefer printed books over e-books. The problems with printed books, however, are that they require physical space in ones' home and are costly to consume. Libaries, on the other hand, although offer a free book rental service to individuals with a valid library card, have become less popular with millenials who are willing to pay for delivery than to visit their local library. With the introduction of Amazon, Postmates, Grubhub, and more, delivery services have become the primary mode of receiving and exchanging products.

### Solution

ReBook aims to offer readers a more affordable way to consume books and shipped to your doorstep! When the reader is ready to return the book, they can simply ship the book back to ReBook at no additional cost. Through ReBook, readers can browse a large collection of trade books spanning across various genres. Registered users are not limited to how many books they can check out a month, but only one book can be checked out at a time. Have books sitting around your home that you no longer want? Readers can also sell their used books to ReBook.

### Target Audience

ReBook's target audience is anyone and everyone who is considered a book lover, book worm, or simply a casual reader.
